<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <link

Adding JS bootstrap:
<body>

  <script
    src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"
    integrity="sha384-kenU1KFdBIe4zVF0s0G1M5b4hcpxyD9F7jL+jjXkk+Q2h455rYXK/7HAuoJl+0I4"

Later on, when we introduce the idea of bundling your application, you will want to use the
Node Package Manager (NPM) to download Bootstrap and include it in your source code so that 
you don't have to rely on someone else's server to provide you with a vital piece of your application. 
To include Bootstrap in your application using NPM you would run the following from your console.
npm install bootstrap@5.2.3
